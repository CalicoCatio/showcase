            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Ariel.
            Online, I go by the username CalicoCatio.
            I love to play and make videogames.
            I also like to make websites, like this one!
            This website is dedicated to all the games and other things that I have made.
            However, some of the projects I have are private, and therefore not found here (at least, for now).
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to make games, websites and other things like them for one reason.
            The feeling of pure satisfaction after I complete a project, or push a new update is unlike any other, and is a feeling that I am constantly chasing.
            Knowing that I completed a project, properly, or at least to the best of my abilities, there is no feeling quite like it.
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a good example of how my abilities change over time:
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Showcase v1, which was a project in high school, I wanted to make a more competent showcase site.
            Enter v2, which wasn't a school project, and just for me; I learnt a lot making that website, and it was lots of fun.
            One of the things that I added was a little strip of text that showed the version of the website.
            I added this because I love to look back on how far I have come, which is also why v2, v3, and now v4 all feature changelog pages, easily accessible in their respective footers.
            When I went to update v2 however, I had to manually change each page's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> since I didn't know about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JS</a> at the time (I was still learning the basics as part of the class where I made v1).
            When I moved over to v3, not only did I start using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, I changed how the version is displayed, so that a JS function held the actual value, and it was added to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="_blank">DOM</a> when the page was loaded
            (<em>Technically</em>, the JS function actually replaced the stand-in <strong>v0.0.1</strong> with the actual version number), and it was pretty seamless.
            I quickly ran into the issue that when I wanted to change the navbar or the footer, I would then have to go to each page and apply the changes manually.
            I had ended up in the same problem as before.
            That is why with v4, I am instead holding the entirety of both the navbar and the footer inside a JS function (that adds them to the DOM when the page gets loaded).
            I have also debated putting the project pages into their own function in much the same way since they tend to be similar.
            However, I have decided against doing so, since I plan to customize each page with their own custom features that are suitible to only that project's page.
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another improvement that I made was the addition of links to other websites.
            After showing v3 (and v2) to my parents, it was clear to me that I had to add a better way of explaining more complex or not well known coding concepts (from the perspective of someone who isn't a CS major), like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank">FSM</a>s, for when I am not there to explain them.
            I also made all links to exterior sites open in another tab so that someone who is interested in learning more can do so, without losing their current position in the text that they were reading here.
            <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For v1, v2, v3, and v4, all of the code written was by me, or another human (like the ones who type up bootstrap).
            Aside from Bootstrap and it's dependencies (and <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> for a <em>smidge</em> of backend when needed [all showcase site versions do not use Node.js]), I don't use any other libraries, frameworks or outside code for my websites.
